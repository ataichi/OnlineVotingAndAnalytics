In light of the upcoming presidential elections our group has created a application that caters to the needs of the both the Candidates, News, Voters and possibly the Government. 

Target users
	

 1. Voters
 2. Candidates

  
Using postgresql and tradeoff analytics we plan to create an application that can provide the candidates useful information regarding the current situation he or she is in

Our application will be able to Gather information on the different aspects of an election 

Each voter will need to have a account registered in the system. Using this account we will able to track the different statistical data that the user provides  

Voters will be able to acquire real time data of the current trend of the current standing of each candidate.

Voters will also be able to input their votes during the pre-election period so that users may see the current rating of candidates.

For the different Candidates they can acquire these different data from our application in real time 

1.Determining The location of low popularity 
			The candidate Should be able to determine areas where he/she has a low rating using statistical data we should be able to direct the user where he/she should focus campaign 

2.Area Population Count
	  The user should also be able to determine the concentration of people in the area. This would allow the candidate information about the number of votes he or she could be able to acquire in a certain area based on population count

3.Be able to check daily updates on trends
	The user will be able to check on the updates on the current standing in specific regions and the total statistics of his/her rating

4.Be able to check on the total budget that the candidate is using 
	The user will be able to check
